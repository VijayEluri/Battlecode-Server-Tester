# Update Instructions #
#######################
Unzip the contents of bs-tester.tar.gz into your current install directory.  That should overwrite
all the necessary files.  You only need to do this to the server; the workers should all be
updated automatically afterwards.

If that does not work (or if you want to be extra-super-careful), unzip the new version into a new 
directory and copy over
static/matches
static/scrimmages
and all files that start with BSTesterDB
