# created by Steven Arcangeli

##################
## REQUIREMENTS ##

    * Linux (mayyyyy also work on Mac.  I haven't tested because I don't own one)
    * Java and Ant (to run the battlecode client)

##################
## ARCHITECTURE ##
##################
This tool is designed to have a server run on some computer visible on the internet.  This computer
acts as the "master" and handles all of the administration.  It runs a web server through which the
user queues and views matches.  The user can install this software on an arbitrary number of 
"worker" computers that will actually run the matches.  The master receives the user commands, 
sends the appropriate matches to the workers, and they send back the results.  The more workers, 
the faster the results.

#######################
## INSTALLING SERVER ##
#######################
To install the server, simply run
./setup.sh
It should prompt you for a few parameters and automatically set up the bs-tester.conf file.

########################
## INSTALLING WORKERS ##
########################
After running setup.sh, the script should have generated a bs-worker.tar.gz file.  Copy this file
to the worker computer (using scp or some other tool).  Then unzip it on the worker and run
./setup.sh
It should prompt you for a couple fields and generate the appropriate config file.  

#############
## RUNNING ##
#############
The server and worker can be run with the run.sh file.  Type
./run.sh -h
to display the available commandline arguments.  

While you *can* run both a master and a worker on the same computer, you should not run them from
the same directory.
