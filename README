# Battlecode Server Tester
# created by Steven Arcangeli

##################
## REQUIREMENTS ##
##################
You need two things in order for this system to work properly:
	* Git or SVN
	* Java and Ant (to run the battlecode client)

##################
## ARCHITECTURE ##
##################
This tool is designed to have a server run on some computer visible on the internet.  This computer
acts as the "master" and handles all of the administration.  It runs a web server through which the
user queues and views matches.  The user can install this software on an arbitrary number of 
"worker" computers that will actually run the matches.  The master receives the user commands, 
sends the appropriate matches to the workers, and they send back the results.  The more workers, 
the faster the results.

#######################
## INSTALLING SERVER ##
#######################
To install the server, simply run
sudo ./setup.sh
It should prompt you for a few parameters and automatically set up the /etc/bs-tester.conf file.

########################
## INSTALLING WORKERS ##
########################
After running setup.sh, the script should have generated a bs-worker.tar.gz file.  Copy this file
to the worker computer (using scp or some other tool).  Then unzip it on the worker and run
sudo ./setup.sh
It should prompt you for just a couple fields and generate the appropriate config file.  

#############
## RUNNING ##
#############
The server and worker can be run with the run.sh file.  Type
./run.sh -h
to display the available commandline arguments.  
If you installed the daemon in the setup script, you can start the service with 
sudo invoke-rc.d bs-tester start

#####################
## VERSION CONTROL ##
#####################
If you use git you will need to use the `git tag` function to tag versions of your code
that you want to run with the tester.  If you are using svn then there is a page on the
website that will allow you to tag different revisions of your code with strings.
