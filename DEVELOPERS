## Architecture ##
##################
There are three main components.  The Server, the Client, and the Web Server.  These can be found in
src/backend, src/client, and src/web respectively.  
The Server - handles the load distribution to the clients and does most of the writes to the DB.  
The Client  - is run on the worker computers and connects to the Server to receive commands.  
    It runs the Battlecode matches by making calls to shell scripts (nasty, but necessary).  
The Web Server - is an embedded server courtesy of Jetty that provides a web interface for 
    viewing and controlling the tests.  The HTML is generated by making calls to a PrintWriter.
    This is approximately the worst way to write HTML in the world, but it's required in order
    to embed the server.
