## Architecture ##
##################
There are three main components.  The Master, the Worker, and the Web Server.  These can be found in
src/master, src/worker, and src/web respectively.  
The Master - handles the load distribution to the workers and does most of the writes to the DB.  
The Worker  - is run on the worker computers and connects to the Master to receive commands.  
    It runs the Battlecode matches by making calls to shell scripts (nasty, but necessary).  
The Web Server - is an embedded server courtesy of Jetty that provides a web interface for 
    viewing and controlling the tests.  The HTML is generated by making calls to a PrintWriter.
    This is approximately the worst way to write HTML in the world, but it's required in order
    to embed the server.  I couldn't figure out how to get JSPs working.

## Building ##
##############
You should be able to compile the project by simply running the command "ant".  This will build
bs-tester.tar.gz which contains everything necessary for installation.

## Testing ##
#############
I recommend *not* running the program from within eclipse.  It reads and writes to a bunch of local
directories, and I prefer not to deal with the pollution of my eclipse workspace.  Instead, I 
create two directories elsewhere (like /tmp) that contain a copy of the master and one of the
worker.  Then if I need to make changes in eclipse and test them, I run "ant build" to build the 
bs-tester.jar file and copy it into the /tmp/server and /tmp/worker directories.  The same thing
goes for the js, css, png and other static files.  If you simply copy them into the directory of
an existing working directory, the new files should be served up automatically without restarting
the server.
